# Minimalistic Implementation of the PyTorch AutoGrad.

Creates a package that defines custom Function and Variable classes. The API structure is similar to the PyTorch implementation allowing automatic gradient computation and backpropogation over a computation graph. 

Demo ipynb shows the use of Variable and Functions to optimize a binary classifier using automatic backpropagation.
